## Abstract
By @vune:
Introduce a model where each validator hosts an endpoint and miners would submit shares to a few of them
they'll be recorded and attested to by validators
which distributes the trust of the pool for verifying work
this would allow miners to mine using their own pool hardware as well, in any geography, they just have to submit valid shares to be compensated

## Abstract

A short (~200 words) description of the issue being addressed and the proposed solution.

## Motivation

The motivation section should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is
inadequate to address the problem that the BIT solves. This is critical for BITs that want to
change the Bittensor protocol. It should clearly explain why the solution outlined in the BIT
is beneficial to the Bittensor ecosystem.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature or
proposed change. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for implementation
without needing to interpret the proposalâ€™s intent.

## Rationale

This section describes why particular design decisions were made. It should address alternative
designs and why they were not chosen, and should discuss the potential impact of the proposal
on the existing system.

## Backwards Compatibility

All BITs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these
incompatibilities and their severity. The BIT must explain how the author proposes to deal with
these incompatibilities. BIT submissions without a sufficient backward compatibility treatise
may be rejected outright.

## Reference Implementation (Optional)

If applicable, include a link to a reference implementation that demonstrates the feasibility
of the proposal. This implementation may be partial or fully complete.

## Security Considerations

All BITs should consider the security implications of their proposals. This section should
address potential attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and how the proposed changes affect the
overall security of the Bittensor protocol.
